                "I have sat here, waiting for you to come back.<br>
                Looking at the phone screen is how I pass the time.<br>
                With you running day and night in my mind.<br>
                How dare you ask me not to text you anymore?<br><br>
                
                I stand here, waiting for your return.<br>
                Gazing at the stars, they say, is a way to look back at the past.<br>
                Each star, so bright, yet not enough to illuminate the earth.<br>
                Am I, too, a star, not enough to brighten your life?<br><br>
                
                I am sleeping on the bed, staring at the ceiling.<br>
                Waiting for a goodnight kiss.<br>
                Dreaming of us and the future is a pleasant dream.<br>
                How can you ask me to sleep with my eyes open?<br><br>
                
                Alt:<br><br>
                
                We sit here all day together, <br>
                Laughter and kisses, time files.<br>
                You chase me, and I chase you. <br>
                You ask me not to go home.<br>
                
                We stand hand in hand, with you leaning on my shoulder.<br>
                We both look at the shooting star and make a wish.<br>
                As the Meteor passes, it transforms the night into day.<br>
                I could see a star in your eyes, knowing it was me.<br><br>
                
                We sleeping together, the best thing yet to happen.<br>
                We having sex.<br>
                We are discussing our future and the next steps in our lives.<br>
                How do we get back to sleeping together?"<br><br>
