<p>hey baby ma</p>
<p>i know its been a while since i called you baby. kissing you is not what is love, talking you on dates is not love, send flirty texts or romantic messages isnt love, giving gifts is not love, clicking good picture isnt what love is, love is respest, standing up to you,supporting you, isnt fighting with you buy fighting for you. it is standing next to you when you are at your worst. is about holding on to tears, trusting, its this unbreakablr emotional bond. and i would like to have this with you. </p>
<p>will you be my girlfriend? <a href="yes.html">Yes, absolutly</a> or die(nin ajji)</p>
<p>i never taught oh me asking you to give me another chance. we all desevere second chances. i dont wanna keep regreting that i would have turned into a better person and you wouldnt have been there. i really wish you give me one last try so i can make things right. ill be the man you dreamt of. ill be your husband. ill take care like no one has ever did, ill bb better that all the guys your mom will show. please give me one last chance.</p>
