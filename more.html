            hey i know its been so long since we spoke like normal couples, i dont know whats gonna happen next, 
            but right now there's no one else i wanna be with more than you. i am not sure if i have lost you completely
            but the thing is i wanna be make everthing right with you and make things work, im ready to put my heard and soul
            into this, and once this is fixed i dont know whats gonna happen, will i go back to being the same old toxic me 
            or will i acutally have changed? i too have no idea. im in a state that even if you come and tell that my love was never
            love i would belive that. its completely upto you to decide on what you wanna do. ill be here waiting for you like the dog
            waits for their owner to come back.
        </div>
        <div>
            To love is to let go. if i say im letting you go. that's the most stupidest thing ever- letting go. well there are other reasons to let you go,
            like the guilt that i left you alone, like the times i choose to be with other people other than you. i am not that great of a person, if you ask me 
            why should you be with me. i really dont have anything to say. i dont know what am i suppose to do. am a kind of person that has no goals nor any ambition
            its like i simply existing and serve no purpose in life. even if i die now, what that something you will rememeber me for? maybe its by the pain i have given you.
