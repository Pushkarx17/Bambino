                <h3>Your Date</h3>
                <p>Today I am very grateful that you took me to Milano, i was waiting from many months for some like this to happen. And it finally did happen, I am soooooo happy. Why do you take bath, everything after you take bath you look soooo pretty that I feel like kissing and hugging, this is after you taking bath, but I wonder what happens if I see you like taking bath, only one way to find out. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">facetime me when you are taking bath. Okay enough of that. Im sorry happy baby you dont know. The outfit you wore was so nice gotha I didnt tell at that time but it is true. I have decided baby no matter how long it takes, I will find a way to become successful, from now on ill give my whole 100% effort in doing anything, and if it still doesn’t work out, ill have no mercy on the gods. It’s time I take things whole rather than simply glancing them over. I dont know baby whenever im with you, there’s nothing more that I need from you, I just wanna be next to you the whole time, if its written that we are not meant to be together then lets re-write it once again how ever we want. What ever we need. Thats all baby, I love-e dove-e you. Bye babyyyyyyy</span></p>
