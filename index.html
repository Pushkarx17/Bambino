And it finally did happen, I am soooooo happy. Why do you take bath, everything after you take bath you look soooo pretty that I feel like kissing and hugging, this is after you taking bath, but I wonder what happens if I see you like taking bath, only one way to find out. facetime me when you are taking bath. Okay enough of that. Im sorry happy baby you dont know. The outfit you wore was so nice gotha I didnt tell at that time but it is true. I have decided baby no matter how long it takes, I will find a way to become successful, from now on ill give my whole 100% effort in doing anything, and if it still doesn’t work out, ill have no mercy on the gods. It’s time I take things whole rather than simply glancing them over. I dont know baby whenever im with you, there’s nothing more that I need from you, I just wanna be next to you the whole time, if its written that we are not meant to be together then lets re-write it once again how ever we want. What ever we need. Thats all baby, I love-e dove-e you. Bye babyyyyyyy ')">
